INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME
==============================

-In the first screen write the IP address of the host (or leave 127.0.0.1 if you're testing the game locally)
Our server is reachable at 188.166.91.184 - Note: Your experience may vary. (we had very variable ping performance, sockets seems to be faster)


PRESS ENTER AFTER YOU ENTER YOUR USERNAME INTO THE TEXT FIELD TO ACTIVATE THE CONNECT BUTTON

-In the second screen you can see the games currently running on the server, if none is available for joining you can
    create one. All the players connecting after the creation of a game will see the game in the list of available games to join.
    
The server will be waiting for four minutes for the game to start. If not enough players connect during that time, the game
will be cancelled and deleted.

How to play:
-------------

The game is pretty straight forward, keep a close eye on the Events to see what is going on, and when it's your turn buttons
    for the available actions will appear. 
    
    In order to move or use an item you have to first click on a sector or on the picture
    of an item. (The sectors are not selectable near the left and right borders,
        please click in the center area near the indication of the coordinate (es. M11) )
        
A red border in the sector indicates your current position, a blue border indicates the selected sector instead.
        
When you can and should end a turn an EndTurn button will appear in the Available Actions section of the screen.
 
If you don't complete your turn in a minute a warning will pop up in the events, if you don't complete
your turn in a minute after the warning you will be considered disconnected from the game.

When you pick a Noise In Any Sector Card your only available action will be Noise. 
When you use a Spotlight Item Card your only available action will be Spotlight.
Please select the sector on which you would like to make a noise or shine a light before pressing the button.

Animations will indicate to everybody where a player attacked or made a noise.

Methods of communication and GUI/CLI are completely interchangeable.
